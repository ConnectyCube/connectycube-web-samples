 *  server. </li>\n   * </ul>\n   *\n   * @param {function} callbacks.consentDialog - this callback is triggered\n   *  just before <b>getUserMedia</b> is called (parameter=<b>true</b>) and\n   *  after it is completed (parameter=<b>false</b>); this means it can be\n   *  used to modify the UI accordingly, e.g., to prompt the user about the\n   *  need to accept the device access consent requests.\n   * @param {function} callbacks.mediaState - this callback is triggered\n   *  when server starts or stops receiving your media: for instance,\n   *  a <b>mediaState</b> with type=audio and on=true means server started\n   *  receiving your audio stream (or started getting them again after\n   *  a pause of more than a second); a mediaState with type=video\n   *  and on=false means server hasn't received any video from you in the\n   *  last second, after a start was detected before; useful to figure out\n   *  when server actually started handling your media, or to detect problems\n   *  on the media path (e.g., media never started, or stopped at some time).\n   * @param {function} callbacks.webrtcState - this callback is triggered\n   *  with a <b>true</b> value when the PeerConnection associated to a handle\n   *  becomes active (so ICE, DTLS and everything else succeeded) from\n   *  the library perspective, while <b>false</b> is triggered when\n   *  the PeerConnection goes down instead; useful to figure out when WebRTC\n   *  is actually up and running between you and server (e.g., to notify\n   *  a user they're actually now active in a conference).\n   * @param {function} callbacks.slowLink - this callback is triggered when\n   *  server reports trouble either sending or receiving media on the\n   *  specified PeerConnection, typically as a consequence of too many NACKs\n   *  received from/sent to the user in the last second: for instance,\n   *  a slowLink with uplink=true means you notified several missing packets\n   *  from server, while uplink=false means server is not receiving all your\n   *  packets; useful to figure out when there are problems on the media\n   *  path (e.g., excessive loss), in order to possibly react accordingly\n   *  (e.g., decrease the bitrate if most of our packets are getting lost).\n   * @param {function} callbacks.oncleanup - the WebRTC PeerConnection with\n   *  the plugin was closed.\n   */\n  attachVideoConferencingPlugin: function (isRemote, userId, callbacks) {\n    var self = this;\n    var remoteFeed = null;\n\n    this.engine.attach({\n      plugin:
